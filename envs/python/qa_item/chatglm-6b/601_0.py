    Count the number of words in a given string.

    A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by whitespace.
    This function handles leading and trailing whitespace, as well as
    multiple spaces between words.

        s (str): The input string in which words are to be counted.

    Returns:
        int: The count of words in the input string.
