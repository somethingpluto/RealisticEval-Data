/**
 * Multiplies a given matrix by a vector using mathjs's multiply function.
 * 
 * @param {Array<Array<number>>} matrix - A 2D array (matrix) of shape (m, n) where m is the number of rows
 *                                        and n is the number of columns.
 * @param {Array<number>} vector - A 1D array (vector) of shape (n,) that represents a vector
 *                                 compatible for multiplication with the given matrix.
 * @returns {Array<number>} - A 1D array (resulting vector) of shape (m,) representing the product of
 *                            the matrix and the vector.
