def assert_999(bit_name: str) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether a given string (assumed to end with ".bit") is a valid 3-digit integer.
    Removes the ".bit" suffix, checks if the remaining part is a number,
    and verifies if it falls within the range of 0 to 999.

    Args:
        bit_name (str): The string to validate, which should end with ".bit".

    Returns:
        bool: True if the remaining part after removing ".bit" is a valid 3-digit integer (0-999);
              otherwise, False.
