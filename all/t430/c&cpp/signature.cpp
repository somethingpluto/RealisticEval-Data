 * - (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
 * - (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 * 
 * @param rect1 A tuple representing the first rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).
 * @param rect2 A tuple representing the second rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).
 * 
 * @return True if the rectangles intersect vertically, False otherwise.
