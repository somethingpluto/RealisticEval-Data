bool intersect_vertically(const std::tuple<int, int, int, int>& rect1, const std::tuple<int, int, int, int>& rect2) {
    /*
    Check whether two rectangles intersect in the vertical direction.

    Each rectangle is defined by a tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2), where:
    - (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
    - (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.

    Args:
        rect1 (std::tuple<int, int, int, int>): The first rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).
        rect2 (std::tuple<int, int, int, int>): The second rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).

    Returns:
        bool: True if the rectangles intersect vertically, False otherwise.
