/**
 * Converts an array of binary bits to an array of bytes. Traverses through each bit,
 * composing these bits into bytes, forming a byte every 8 bits, and then storing these
 * bytes in an array and returning it. If the length of the bit array is not a multiple
 * of 8, the last incomplete byte will be discarded.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} bits - The input array of bits (each element should be 0 or 1).
 * @returns {Uint8Array} An array of bytes constructed from the bits.
