/**
 * @brief Convert an array of binary bits to an array of bytes. Traverse through each bit,
 * composing these bits into bytes, forming a byte every 8 bits, and then store
 * these bytes in a vector and return it. If the length of the bit array is not a
 * multiple of 8, the last incomplete byte will be discarded.
 *
 * @param bits A vector of integers representing the input array of bits (each element should be 0 or 1).
 * @return A vector of bytes constructed from the bits.
