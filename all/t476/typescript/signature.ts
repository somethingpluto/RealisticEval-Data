/**
 * Achieves topological sorting based on depth-first search.
 *
 * @param vertices - A list of vertices in the graph. Each vertex should be a unique integer.
 * @param edges - A list of tuples where each tuple represents a directed edge in the graph,
 *                formed as (start_vertex, end_vertex).
 * @returns A list of vertices in topological order. If the graph contains a cycle,
 *          and thus cannot have a valid topological ordering, an empty list is returned.
