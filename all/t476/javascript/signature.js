/**
 * Achieves topological sorting based on depth-first search (DFS).
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} vertices - A list of vertices in the graph. Each vertex should be a unique integer.
 * @param {Array<[number, number]>} edges - A list of tuples where each tuple represents a directed edge
 *                                          in the graph and is formed as [start_vertex, end_vertex].
 * @returns {Array<number>} - A list of vertices in topological order. If the graph contains a cycle,
 *                            and thus cannot have a valid topological ordering, an empty array is returned.
