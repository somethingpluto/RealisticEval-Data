 * @brief Classifies JSON objects from a source file based on a list of PIDs.

 * This function reads JSON data from a specified source file, classifies each object 
 * into matches and mismatches based on the presence of their 'pid' in a provided list,
 * and then saves the classified objects into separate JSON files.
 *
 * @param source_file The path to the input JSON file containing the objects.
 * @param pid_list A vector of PIDs to match against the 'pid' field of the JSON objects.
 * @param match_file The path to the output JSON file where matched objects will be saved.
 * @param mismatch_file The path to the output JSON file where unmatched objects will be saved.
