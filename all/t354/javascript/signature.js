/**
 * Calculates the Gaussian weight based on the difference in intensity and a color standard deviation.
 *
 * The Gaussian weight is calculated using the formula:
 * weight = exp(- (intensityDiff^2) / (2 * sigmaColor^2))
 *
 * @param {number} intensityDiff The difference in intensity, which is used to compute the weight.
 * @param {number} sigmaColor The standard deviation for the color, affecting the spread of the weight.
 * @return {number} The Gaussian weight.
