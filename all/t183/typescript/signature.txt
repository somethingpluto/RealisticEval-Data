Here’s the equivalent TypeScript code, converting the C++ function and class signatures while adapting comments and types appropriately:

```typescript
interface Point {
    x: number; // X-coordinate of the point
    y: number; // Y-coordinate of the point
}

interface Ray {
    origin: Point;     // Starting point of the ray
    direction: Point;  // Direction of the ray (should be normalized)
}

interface Circle {
    center: Point;     // Center of the circle
    radius: number;    // Radius of the circle
}

/**
 * @brief Determines whether a ray intersects with a circle.
 *
 * This function checks if a given ray intersects with a specified circle
 * in a 2D space. It performs mathematical calculations to determine if
 * the ray, defined by its origin and direction, crosses the area of the
 * circle defined by its center and radius.
 *
 * @param ray The ray to be tested for intersection. It is assumed to
 * contain properties such as an origin point and a direction vector.
 * @param circle The circle to check for intersection. It is assumed to
 * contain properties such as a center point and a radius.
 *
 * @return true if the ray intersects the circle; false otherwise.
 */
function intersects(ray: Ray, circle: Circle): boolean {
    // Function implementation would go here
    return false; // Placeholder return
}
```

### Key Changes:
- **Structures to Interfaces**: C++ `struct` is replaced with TypeScript `interface`.
- **Type Declarations**: `float` is converted to `number`, which is the TypeScript equivalent.
- **Comments**: C++ style comments have been converted to TypeScript-style comments. The docstring format has been preserved.
- **Function Signature**: The function signature has been adapted to TypeScript syntax. The function body is left as a placeholder for implementation.
