Here’s the equivalent JavaScript code for the provided C++ function and class signatures, with comments converted appropriately:

```javascript
class Point {
    constructor(x, y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

class Ray {
    constructor(origin, direction) {
        this.origin = origin;     // Starting point of the ray
        this.direction = direction; // Direction of the ray (should be normalized)
    }
}

class Circle {
    constructor(center, radius) {
        this.center = center; // Center of the circle
        this.radius = radius; // Radius of the circle
    }
}

/**
 * @brief Determines whether a ray intersects with a circle.
 *
 * This function checks if a given ray intersects with a specified circle
 * in a 2D space. It performs mathematical calculations to determine if
 * the ray, defined by its origin and direction, crosses the area of the
 * circle defined by its center and radius.
 *
 * @param ray The ray to be tested for intersection. It is assumed to
 * contain properties such as an origin point and a direction vector.
 * @param circle The circle to check for intersection. It is assumed to
 * contain properties such as a center point and a radius.
 *
 * @return true if the ray intersects the circle; false otherwise.
 */
function intersects(ray, circle) {
    // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Class Declarations**: C++ structs are converted into JavaScript classes with constructor methods.
2. **Comment Conversion**: C++ comments are translated into JavaScript-style comments, maintaining their context.
3. **Function Signature**: The `intersects` function is declared using JavaScript syntax, removing the type specifications from the parameters.
