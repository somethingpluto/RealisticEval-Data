Sure! Below is the equivalent TypeScript code for the provided Python code. This includes defining types and adapting the logic to fit TypeScript conventions:

```typescript
import { PriorityQueue } from 'typescript-collections';

/**
 * Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.
 *
 * @param graph - A dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph. Each key is a node, and the value is a list of tuples (neighbor, weight).
 * @param start - The starting node for the shortest path search.
 * @returns A dictionary with the shortest distance from the start node to each node.
 */
function dijkstra(graph: Record<string, Array<[string, number]>>, start: string): Record<string, number> {
    // Priority queue for the minimum distance nodes
    const queue = new PriorityQueue<[number, string]>((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    // Dictionary to store the shortest path to each node
    const shortestPaths: Record<string, number> = {};
    Object.keys(graph).forEach(node => {
        shortestPaths[node] = Infinity;
    });
    shortestPaths[start] = 0;
    // Push the starting node with distance 0 into the queue
    queue.enqueue([0, start]);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        const [currentDistance, currentNode] = queue.dequeue()!;
        
        // If the distance is greater than the recorded shortest path, skip processing
        if (currentDistance > shortestPaths[currentNode]) {
            continue;
        }

        // Explore neighbors
        for (const [neighbor, weight] of graph[currentNode]) {
            const distance = currentDistance + weight;

            // Only consider this new path if it's better
            if (distance < shortestPaths[neighbor]) {
                shortestPaths[neighbor] = distance;
                queue.enqueue([distance, neighbor]);
            }
        }
    }

    return shortestPaths;
}

// Example usage
const graph: Record<string, Array<[string, number]>> = {
    'A': [['B', 1], ['C', 4]],
    'B': [['A', 1], ['C', 2], ['D', 5]],
    'C': [['A', 4], ['B', 2], ['D', 1]],
    'D': [['B', 5], ['C', 1]]
};

console.log(dijkstra(graph, 'A'));
```

### Explanation:
1. **Priority Queue**: TypeScript does not have a built-in priority queue, so we use the `typescript-collections` library which provides a `PriorityQueue` class.
2. **Type Definitions**: We define types for the graph (`Record<string, Array<[string, number]>>`) and the shortest paths (`Record<string, number>`).
3. **Initialization**: We initialize the `shortestPaths` object and enqueue the starting node with distance 0.
4. **Loop**: We process the queue until it is empty, updating the shortest paths as needed.
5. **Example Usage**: An example graph is provided to demonstrate how to call the `dijkstra` function.

This TypeScript code maintains the same functionality and logic as the original Python code, while adhering to TypeScript's static type system and conventions.
