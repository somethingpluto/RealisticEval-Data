/**
 * Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.
 * @param {Object} graph - An object representing the adjacency list of the graph. Each key is a node, and the value is an array of objects {neighbor, weight}.
 * @param {string} start - The starting node for the shortest path search.
 * @returns {Object} - An object with the shortest distance from the start node to each node.
