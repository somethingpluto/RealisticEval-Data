/**
 * @brief Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.
 * 
 * @param graph An unordered_map representing the adjacency list of the graph. Each key is a node, and the value is a vector of pairs (neighbor, weight).
 * @param start The starting node for the shortest path search.
 * 
 * @return An unordered_map with the shortest distance from the start node to each node.
