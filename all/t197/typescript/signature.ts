 * This function creates an instance of the PrimeGame class, which encapsulates the logic
 * for simulating the game. It then calls the findOrder method on the PrimeGame object
 * to determine and return the order in which players are removed based on the sequence of prime numbers.
 *
 * @param n The number of players in the game.
 * @return An array of numbers representing the order of players being removed from the ring.
