 * @brief Divide a vector evenly into n parts and return a vector of these parts.
 * If the vector length is not divisible by n, additional elements are added to the previous sections one by one.
 *
 * @param lst The vector to be divided.
 * @param n The number of parts to divide the vector into.
 * @return A vector containing n subvectors, where each subvector represents a part of the original vector.
