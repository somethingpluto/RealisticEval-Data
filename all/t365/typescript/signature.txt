Here’s the equivalent TypeScript function signature with comments converted appropriately:

```typescript
/**
 * @brief Calculates the day of the week for a given date.
 *
 * @param year The year of the date (e.g., 2024).
 * @param month The month of the date (1 = January, 2 = February, ..., 12 = December).
 * @param day The day of the month (1 to 31, depending on the month).
 * 
 * @return An integer representing the day of the week:
 *         - 1 for Monday
 *         - 2 for Tuesday
 *         - 3 for Wednesday
 *         - 4 for Thursday
 *         - 5 for Friday
 *         - 6 for Saturday
 *         - 7 for Sunday
 */
function dayOfWeek(year: number, month: number, day: number): number {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

This retains the original functionality and structure while adapting to TypeScript conventions. Would you like to delve into further conversions or specifics?
