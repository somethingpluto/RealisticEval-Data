/**
 * Reads sequences from a file and determines if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
 * The definition of the Munodi sequence is based on a specific recursive relationship,
 * that is, for even numbers, the next term is half of it, for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1,
 * and the sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
 * For example: (2, 4, 6, 8) is a Munodi sequence.
 *
 * @param {string} filename - The file path containing the sequences.
 * @returns {Object} An object mapping each sequence to a boolean indicating whether it is a Munodi sequence.
