/**
 * Reads multiple sequences from the file and determines if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
 * The definition of the Munodi sequence is based on a specific recursive relationship:
 * for even numbers, the next term is half of it, and for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1.
 * The sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
 * 
 * Example: (2, 4, 6, 8) is a Munodi sequence.
 * 
 * @param filename the file path containing the sequences
 * @return a map where keys are the sequences and values indicate whether they are Munodi sequences
