/**
 * Reads multiple sequences from the file and determines if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
 * The definition of the Munodi sequence is based on a specific recursive relationship:
 * for even numbers, the next term is half of it, for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1,
 * and the sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
 * For example: (2, 4, 6, 8) is a Munodi sequence.
 *
 * @param filename - The file path containing the sequences.
 * @returns An object mapping each sequence (as a string) to a boolean indicating whether it is a Munodi sequence.
