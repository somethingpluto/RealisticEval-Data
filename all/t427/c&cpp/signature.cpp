std::map<std::vector<int>, bool> check_sequences(const std::string& filename) {
    // Function to read sequences from a file and determine if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
    // The definition of the Munodi sequence is based on a specific recursive relationship,
    // that is, for even numbers, the next term is half of it, for odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1,
    // and the sequence terminates when it encounters 1.
    // For example: (2, 4, 6, 8) is a Munodi sequence.
    //
    // Args:
    //     filename (std::string): File path
    //
    // Returns:
    //     std::map<std::vector<int>, bool>: Map of sequences and whether they are Munodi sequences
