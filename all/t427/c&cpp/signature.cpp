/**
 * @brief Reads sequences from a file and determines if each sequence is a "Munodi sequence".
 * 
 * The Munodi sequence is defined by the following recursive relationship:
 * - For even numbers, the next term is half of the current number.
 * - For odd numbers, the next term is 3*n + 1.
 * - The sequence terminates when it reaches 1.
 * 
 * For example, the sequence (2, 4, 6, 8) is a Munodi sequence.
 * 
 * @param filename The path to the file containing sequences.
 * 
 * @return A map where the keys are the sequences (as vectors of integers) and the values are booleans indicating whether the sequence is a valid Munodi sequence.
