Hereâ€™s the TypeScript version of the provided C++ function, including the necessary adaptations for type declarations and comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Implement a function that performs Shell sort on an array
 * @param arr - The array to be sorted
 */
function shellSort(arr: number[]): void {
}
```

### Key Adaptations:
- Changed the function signature to TypeScript, replacing `std::vector<int>&` with `number[]`.
- Used `void` for the return type, as in C++.
- Converted C++ comments to TypeScript-style comments (`/** */` for documentation and `//` for single-line comments).
