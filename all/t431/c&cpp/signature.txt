Here’s the converted C++ function signature with comments:

```cpp
#include <tuple>

// Determines if two rectangles intersect horizontally.
// Each rectangle is defined by a tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2), where:
// - (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner.
// - (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
//
// @param rect1 The first rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).
// @param rect2 The second rectangle defined by (x1, y1, x2, y2).
// @return True if the rectangles intersect horizontally, False otherwise.
bool intersect_horizontally(const std::tuple<int, int, int, int>& rect1, const std::tuple<int, int, int, int>& rect2) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

In this conversion, I have preserved the original purpose and structure of the Python code. The type annotations `tuple` in Python are represented as `std::tuple<int, int, int, int>` in C++. The comments and docstring have been converted into appropriate C++ comments.
