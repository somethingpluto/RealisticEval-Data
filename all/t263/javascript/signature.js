/**
 * Traverse a given m x n matrix in a spiral order and return all elements as an array.
 *
 * The function starts at the top-left corner of the matrix and traverses it in a
 * clockwise spiral order, moving right across the top row, down the right column,
 * left across the bottom row, and up the left column, repeating this process
 * until all elements are traversed.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} matrix - A 2D array representing the matrix with m rows and n columns.
 * @returns {number[]} An array of numbers representing the elements of the matrix
 *                     in the order they were traversed.
