/**
 * Generates all possible combinations of elements from a list of lists.
 * Each combination consists of picking exactly one element from each list in the input list of lists.
 * This method is useful for generating product variations, scenarios in decision-making tools,
 * or any context where all possible combinations of a set of options need to be explored.
 *
 * @param inputLists - A list of lists containing the elements to combine.
 *                     The lists must not be empty but can contain elements of any type.
 * @returns A list of lists, where each inner list represents a possible combination of elements
 *          taken from the input lists. Returns an empty list if the input list is empty.
