Here’s the Java code signature with comments translated from the JavaScript version:

```java
/**
 * Parse a cron expression and determine whether it is between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
 * @param cronExpression the cron expression to parse
 * @return true if the hours are between 2 and 4 a.m., otherwise false
 */
public boolean isCronBetween2And4AM(String cronExpression) {
    // Implementation will go here
}
``` 

This maintains the structure and comments while adapting it to Java syntax.
