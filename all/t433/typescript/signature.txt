Here's the TypeScript code signature for the provided Python function, keeping the comments intact:

```typescript
/**
 * Extracts paragraphs and lines from the given text. Paragraphs end with '\n\n' and lines end with '\n'.
 * 
 * Example:
 *      Input: "First paragraph.\nThis is the second line.\n\nSecond paragraph.\nAnother line."
 *      Output: {
 *          paragraphs: ["First paragraph.", "This is the second line."],
 *          lines: ["First paragraph.", "This is the second line.", "Second paragraph.", "Another line."]
 *      }
 * 
 * @param text - The input text from which paragraphs and lines will be extracted.
 * @returns An object containing:
 *          - `paragraphs`: A list of paragraphs extracted from the text.
 *          - `lines`: A list of lines extracted from the text.
 */
function extractParagraphsAndLines(text: string): { paragraphs: string[], lines: string[] } {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
```

In this TypeScript version, I've used JSDoc style comments to document the function parameters and return value, similar to how you would in Python using docstrings. The return type is specified using TypeScript syntax (`{ paragraphs: string[], lines: string[] }`).
