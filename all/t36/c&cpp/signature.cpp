/**
 * @brief Implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices
 * in a graph represented by an adjacency matrix.
 *
 * @param adjacency_matrix A 2D vector representing the graph, where adjacency_matrix[i][j] is the weight
 *                         of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. If there is no edge, the weight should
 *                         be represented as INT_MAX.
 * @return A 2D vector representing the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. shortest_paths[i][j]
 *         will hold the shortest distance from vertex i to vertex j.
